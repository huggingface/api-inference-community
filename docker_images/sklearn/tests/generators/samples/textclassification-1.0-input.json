That does not mean,\nhowever, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The\nentire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews\nto have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of\nthem, and which had been denied to them for millenia.\n\nOn the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the\nbest of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided\ndamage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies\nof previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and\nbigotry.\n\n\n-- \n________________________________________\nJack F.
