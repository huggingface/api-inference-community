# TIMEOUT env variable is used by nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:xx for another purpose
# rendering TIMEOUT defined by uvicorn impossible to use correctly
# We're overriding it to be renamed UVICORN_TIMEOUT
# UVICORN_TIMEOUT is a useful variable for very large models that take more
# than 30s (the default) to load in memory.
# If UVICORN_TIMEOUT is too low, uvicorn will simply never loads as it will
# kill workers all the time before they finish.
